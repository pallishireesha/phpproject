            <h3 class="p-3 text-bg-secondary ">Appeal Before Appellate Authority:</h3>
            Any person who thinks that the order or decision by the adjudicating authority is not as per law then such person can file an appeal to the Appellate Authority. The appeal should be filed within three months of communication of order or decision to such person.
            Commissioner may at its own motion call for and examine the record of any proceedings in which an adjudicating authority has passed an order or decision. He may direct any subordinate officer to apply to the Appellate authority. The appeal should be filed within six months from the date of communication of such order or decision. In such case, such authorized officer should be considered as an appellant.
            As per Section 2(4) of CGST Act, “adjudicating authority” means any authority, appointed or authorised to pass any order or decision under this Act, but does not include the Central Board of Excise and Customs, the Revisional Authority, the Authority for Advance Ruling, the Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling, the Appellate Authority and the Appellate Tribunal;
            If appellate authority is satisfied that appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the aforesaid period of three months or six months, as the case may be, allow it to be presented within a further period of one month.
            <br><i>Payment Before Appeal:</i><br>
            When the appeal before appellate authority is made by the registered person then such appeal can be made only after the appellant has paid the tax, interest, fine, fee and penalty in the order, which has been admitted by him. The appellant is also required to pay 10% of the remaining amount of tax in dispute (maximum Rs. 25 crore) arising from the order, in relation to which appeal has been filed.
            When such amount is paid by the appellant, the recovery for the balance amount shall be deemed to be stayed.
           <br><i>Procedure of Appeal:</b></i><br>
            Such appeal is to be made in Form GST APL-01, along with relevant documents. A provisional acknowledgement will be issued immediately. Within 7 days of filing GST APL-01, a certified copy of decision or order in dispute is to be submitted and a final acknowledgment indicating appeal number shall be issued in Form GST APL-02.
            Where the certified copy is submitted within 7 days of filing GST APL-01 then date of filing GST APL-01 shall be considered as date of filing appeal. If certified copy is submitted after 7 days, then date of submission of copy is considered as date of filing appeal.
            When the subordinate officer of commissioner is filing appeal then he has to file such appeal in Form GST APL-03 and submit within 7 days a certified copy of the decision or order.
            If any sufficient cause is shown at time of hearing then Appellate authority may grant time to parties and adjourn the hearing. The reasons are to be recorded in writing. Such adjournment may be given maximum three times to a party.
            Appellate authority shall after making inquiry, pass an order as it thinks proper, confirming, annulling or modifying the decision or order. Appellate authority shall not refer the case back to adjudicating authority that passed the order or decision in dispute.
            Appellant should be given proper opportunity of being heard if any order enhancing any fee or penalty or reducing the amount of refund or input tax credit is to be given.
            The order disposing of the appeal shall be in writing and shall state the points for determination, decision and reasons for such decision.
            A copy of order is to be communicated to the appellant, respondent and to the adjudicating authority.
            <br><i>Time in which appeal should be disposed off:</i><br>
            The Appellate Authority should hear and decide every appeal within a period of one year from the date on which it is filed. The words use here is “where it is possible to do so”, therefore there is no legal binding on Appellate Authority to pass such order within one year only.
            Also, where issuance of order is stayed by an order of a court or Tribunal, the period of such stay shall be excluded in computing the period of one year.
            Appellate Authority
        
            <br><i>Any person can file his appeal to:</i><br>
            <li>

            <h3 class="p-3 text-bg-secondary ">Raising an Appeal to the High Court and Supreme Court under GST:</h3>
            
             
            Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India, disputes and grievances may arise between businesses, individuals, and the government. In such cases, the Appellate Tribunal under GST provides a platform for the resolution of these disputes. However, if the aggrieved party is still not satisfied with the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, they may choose to raise an appeal to the High Court.
            In this article, we will cover the basics of raising an Appeal under GST to the top-tier authorities i.e. the High Court and the Supreme court.
           <h3 class="p-3 text-bg-secondary "> Raising an Application to the High Court:</h3>
            High Court is the second-highest appeal forum available under GST i.e. if an appellant is unhappy with the outcome of a case (involving a substantial question of law ) as prescribed by the  Appellate Tribunal, the appellant can raise an appeal against the order to the High Court. However, it should be noted that the appeal should be raised within 6 months from the date of issuance of the order (against which the appeal is made).
            <br><li><b>When can an appeal be raised to the High Court under GST?</b></li>
            An appeal can be raised to the High Court under GST in the following situations:
            <ol>
            1.	When the aggrieved party is dissatisfied with the decision of the Appellate Tribunal<br>
            2.	When the Appellate Tribunal has failed to pass an order or decision within the specified time period<br>
            3.	When the Appellate Tribunal has passed an order that is deemed to be illegal or unjust
            </ol>
            It should be noted that cases involving a substantial question of law only are admissible for appeal in High Court. The High Court shall formulate the substantial question of law involved in any case and hear the appeals on the basis of the question, which is open for argument by the respondent at the time of the hearing.
            <br><li><i>The High Court can decide on any issue which –</i></li>
            (a) has not been determined by the State Bench or Area Benches OR
            <br>(b) has been wrongly determined by the State Bench or Area Benches, due to the question of law raised.
            <br>
            For any appeal between 2 or more states or for a conflict of opinion between the State and the Centre, the cases will go directly to the Supreme Court.
           <h3 class="p-3 text-bg-secondary ">Procedure for raising an appeal to the High Court under GST:</h3>
         The procedure for raising an appeal to the High Court under GST involves the following steps:</i>
            <ol>
        
            1.	The aggrieved party must file a written appeal with the High Court within 60 days of the receipt of the order or decision of the Appellate Tribunal.
            <br>2.	The appeal must be accompanied by a copy of the order or decision being appealed against, as well as any relevant supporting documents and evidence.
            <br>3.	The High Court will then issue a notice to the respondent, who must file a reply within a specified time period.
           <br> 4.	The High Court may then hold a hearing to resolve the dispute, during which both the aggrieved party and the respondent may present their arguments and evidence.

            <h4>An Appeal to the High Court and Supreme Court under GST:</h4>
            Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India, disputes and grievances may arise between businesses, individuals, and the government. In such cases, the Appellate Tribunal under GST provides a platform for the resolution of these disputes. However, if the aggrieved party is still not satisfied with the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, they may choose to raise an appeal to the High Court.
            In this article, we will cover the basics of raising an Appeal under GST to the top-tier authorities i.e. the High Court and the Supreme court.
           <h3 class="p-3 text-bg-secondary ">Raising an Application to the High Court:</h3>
            High Court is the second-highest appeal forum available under GST i.e. if an appellant is unhappy with the outcome of a case (involving a substantial question of law ) as prescribed by the  Appellate Tribunal, the appellant can raise an appeal against the order to the High Court. However, it should be noted that the appeal should be raised within 6 months from the date of issuance of the order (against which the appeal is made).
            <li><b>When can an appeal be raised to the High Court under GST?</b></li>
            An appeal can be raised to the High Court under GST in the following situations:

            <br>2.	When the Appellate Tribunal has failed to pass an order or decision within the specified time period
            <br> 3.	When the Appellate Tribunal has passed an order that is deemed to be illegal or unjust
            </ol>
            It should be noted that cases involving a substantial question of law only are admissible for appeal in High Court. The High Court shall formulate the substantial question of law involved in any case and hear the appeals on the basis of the question, which is open for argument by the respondent at the time of the hearing.
            <br><b> The High Court can decide on any issue which –</b>
            <ol>
            <br>(a) has not been determined by the State Bench or Area Benches OR
            <br>(b) has been wrongly determined by the State Bench or Area Benches, due to the question of law raised.
            </ol>
            For any appeal between 2 or more states or for a conflict of opinion between the State and the Centre, the cases will go directly to the Supreme Court.
